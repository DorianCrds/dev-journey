# Dev Journey

This repository documents my **project-based journey to explore software development**.

The goal of this journey is not to build large or production-ready applications,  
but to **experiment with the main types of software applications** in a structured way,
in order to understand:
- what each type of application is used for
- its technical constraints
- the skills required to build it
- and which areas of development I enjoy the most

Each project is intentionally **small, focused, and self-contained**.

---

## Philosophy

> Learn development by building, not by following isolated tutorials.

Instead of going deep into a single technology, this journey focuses on:
- **breadth first**, then depth
- real, concrete applications
- finishing projects (even simple ones)
- understanding how different parts of software development fit together

---

## Learning approach & tooling

Throughout this journey, I use ChatGPT as a **guided learning assistant**, prompted as a development trainer rather than a code generator.
It helps me structure projects step by step, perform design and code reviews, and draft documentation (README, CHANGELOG, releases), while all implementation decisions and coding are done manually by me.
