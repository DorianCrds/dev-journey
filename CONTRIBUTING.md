Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!
Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving the documentation, please follow the commit message conventions below to keep the project history clean and consistent.

## Commit Message Convention

The project follows the **Conventionnal Commits** specification.

```bash
<type>(optionnal scope): short description
```

- **type**: the category of change
- **scope** (optional): the part of the project affected
- **description**: a short, present-tense sentence that clearly describes the change

## Allowed Types

| Type     | Description                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| feat     | A new feature                                          |
| fix      | A bug fix                                              |
| docs     | Documentation updates only                             |
| style    | Changes that do not affect logic (formatting, spacing) |
| refactor | Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature  |
| test     | Adding or updating tests                               |
| chore    | Maintenance tasks (build, CI, dependencies, etc.)      |

## Examples

## Best Practices

- Keep commits focused: one purpose per commit
- Use clear and concise messages
- Start the description with a verb in the present tense (add, fix, update, etc.)
- Avoid ending the message with a period
- Use English for commit messages
